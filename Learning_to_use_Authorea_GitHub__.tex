Learning to use Authorea ... GitHub integration looks promising. The web interface is nice. It looks like you work on a document one paragraph at a time. Ah, a new .tex file was created automatically for this new paragraph. Authorea pushed to my GitHub as soon as I clicked on "Save and Close" and the changes are visible on the "History" tab, and on the commit history in GitHub.

I can add a new paragraph within the "Edit" box.

One thing I don't like is that it seems to do a complete deletion of the contents of the Edit box, and then an addition of all the contents, for even an edit on a separate line. Hmm.
